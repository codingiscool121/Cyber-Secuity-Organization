## CISC 4900 game world.
**This is a first [prototype](https://vladglad.itch.io/phaser-rpg?secret=6ltnySNslGpibAeh8dyZCC8PotI) of my module made using [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io) HTML5 game framework.**

   * Example:
    ```html
    <head>
      <!-- MY SCRIPTS -->
      <script src="scenes/boot.js"></script>
      ...
      <script defer src="scripts/contentSwitcher.js"></script>
      <script defer src="scripts/other.js"></script>


      <!-- YOUR SCRIPTS -->
      <script src="scripts/module1.js"></script>
      ...

    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- MY DIV -->
      <div id="gameContainer"></div>


      <!-- YOUR DIVS-->
      <div class="gameModule" id="module0"></div>
      ...
    </body>
    ```

   ...
   
   
   /**
    * When done with education/learning part; 
    * Just hides your div and displays the game world.
    * @param arg - optional arg for your div's ID to hide it afterwards (if not in class="gameModule").
    */
   switchBack(arg);
   
   /**
    * When done with evaluation part; 
    * Same as before but also informs if completion of the module was successful or not.
    * @param completed - boolean value: true for successful completion, false otherwise.
    * @param arg - optional arg (same as before).
    */
   switchWithCondition(completed, arg);
   ```
   * Note: Every module would be loaded in and on the stand-by, hiden form the player's view; Upon encountering enemy switching will take place -> the game world will be hiden and one of the modules will show up. When exiting with `switchWithCondition(boolean)` an enemy representing your module would behave differently - success means enemy forever disappears, failure enemy is temporary disabled and will later be reactivated to let players try again.
5. Whenever you got it to work locally, issue a new pull request (This will notify and allow me to merge your local commits/changes to the master branch). 
6. Success. You've done it. Nice work!

___
##What I need to do now
## Available Scripts (to run the game locally).
### 1. Prerequisites:
* Node.js installed on your machine.
* git clone or download this repository.

### 2. In the project directory, you can run:
#### `npm install`
Installs all dependencies necessary, namely http-server.

#### `npm start`
Starts local server and opens default browser to run the game on localhost.

___

**(Week 11-12) Brief updates:**
* Enemy AI that chases after the player.
* Each enemy is identified by their `moduleID` which triggers an appropriate module (out of 5 possible). 
* Modularization of some components (such as MovementManager) to reuse them in other Phaser3 Scenes.
* Content switcher API - one .js file that allows to interface with the game world and control which game module (represented as `<div>` is presented to the player.
* Upon completion of a game module, successful or otherwise, resource indicator and map of contamination change; hearts get taken away, map gets gradually "cleaner."

___

**(Week 7-10) Updates:** 
* My repo is (and has been) public - all commits/updates could be seen directly.
* In-game menu that lets pause the game, change options such as music and controls, and exit the game to the title screen.
* Title screen and some animation; transition to the game.
* In-game map of the world that is dynamically (at random) changes colors to indicate “cyber-threat” severity.
* Transition between game zones and universal character controls -> either arrows or “wasd”
* New “Tavern” game zone with new way to interact with npc: overhead text.
* Introduced a way to integrate a “Phishing” module.
* Lots of tweaks and fixes.
* Checkout and run the game locally in just **two** terminal commands (see "Available Scripts" section).

___

**(Week 5-6) Updates:**
* First prototype of Title screen.
* New assets preload sequence for better performance (loading times).
* Player UI: health indicator (or other resources that we will implement).
* Pause icon and corresponding interface menue.
* First concept of transition between worlds/biomes.
* Testing new concepts of collision detection improvements between the player and game objects.
* Minor tile map updates.

**Considering new things to be done in the next Update:**
- [X] Pause menu logic (stop player from moving when this menu is open and do approppriate actions "Resume, Options, Quit).
- [X] "Phishing" mechanic implementation (as proposed by Jerfyn).
- [X] Title screen animation and other fine cosmetic addjustments to the game.
- [ ] Update tiled map layout and addjust collisions (player & world).
- [X] In game World map and contamination/decontamination concept of our game (very ironic given current state of the world).

**Optional:**
- [X] Player control with WASD (not necessary, but may be later switched from Options menu).
- [ ] New Enemies (loading atlas files in .JSON format).
- [X] Basic enemy AI.
- [ ] Character invincibility frames when hit/collided with an enemy.

___

**(Week 3-4) What has been done:**
* Bug fixed when exiting Scenes: could not exit a Scene due to overlap of game objects.
* Configured "smooth" transitioning between Scenes -> no more Scene restart (on exiting).
* Configured a cycalable dialog Scene with an NPC.
* Tested audio capabilities of Phaser3 and logic to turn on/pause/reume music. (Things don't have to be 8-bit "Retro", you can go as epic as you would like; the only limit is resources and time).
* Explored possibility of loading and using HTML DOM elements into Phaser3.
* Introduced new Scene BookInteraction: where players solve a decryption puzzle. Input check and evaluated (only rudiments so far; the full logic is to be implemented in the future).

**Alternative idea for the game:**
* As we disussed during the 2nd meeting: we could have a world map completely contaminated and it is a player's task to decontaminate the world from this cybersecurity threat. 
* As players travel through this world they learn things from NPCs and need to solve problems introduced in our modules upon encountering enemies.
* Upon succesful progress, world gets gradually cleansed from this threat.

**Potential problems and concerns:**
* **Heavily** time consuming (complexity).
* We are limited on time: when to integrate and polish.

___

**(Week 1-2) Things that had been done:**
* Learned the basics of Phaser3: Loading resources - images spritesheets, creating animation, using "Arcade" physics, scene managemnet, update logic.
* Created two layers of a top-down 2D styled RPG environment to explore using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org "map editor").
* Loaded this environment as a JSON format.
* There are currently 3 scenes: world exploration, turn-based battle, dialog with NPC.
* Hosted the module on [itch.io](https://vladglad.itch.io/phaser-rpg?secret=6ltnySNslGpibAeh8dyZCC8PotI)
* Actual teaching process is to be implemented.

**Things to consider during our next meeting (Still relevant):**
* Team communication: should consider setting up a group chat.
* How should modules be integrated? Is my module standalone or other consepts could be included within my module? (What role does my module play in the final product?)
* Too ambitious? Follow through with this module or abandon it due to a possible complexity and instead create something simpler - like a visual novel.
